/*
    Explanation:
    - Keywords are reserved words in C that have special meaning.
      Example: int, float, if, else, return, for, while, etc.
    - Identifiers are the names we give to variables, functions, arrays,
      etc., defined by the programmer. Example: age, sum, main, myVar, etc.
